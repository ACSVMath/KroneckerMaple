# Kronecker.mpl

This repository hosts the `Kronecker.mpl` Maple package from the paper
[Effective Coefficient Asymptotics of Multivariate Rational Functions via 
Semi-Numerical Algorithms for Polynomial Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04187)
by Stephen Melczer and Bruno Salvy, Journal of Symbolic Computation, Volume 103, 234â€“279, 2021.

The two Maple worksheets in the repository illustrate the package, and cover examples from the paper.
